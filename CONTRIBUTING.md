# Send me your pull requests ...

If you have a change, new problem, fix, added solution, etc...  Feel free to send a pull request.
Try to keep the formatting as close as possible to some of the nicer problems (the early sections are most cleaned up).
The problems come from OPL, and there the quality varies, and some of the problems are quite a mess.  I'd like to make them all
reasonably simple and consistent in formatting and wording, and I'd like to make the code easy to read and modify
(currently it is quite messy in places).  For example one change I've already mostly made is that there are no labeled parts
"a),b),c)".  The problem with that is that for example Edfinity labels the inputs for the students by letters, and if a part
has more than one input, this can easily get confusing.  Since we're filling in the answer directly into the problem, there is
no need to refer to parts anywhere unlike in traditional homework which is generally "filled out" on a piece of paper
that's distinct from the problem.  Best, to keep the number of random labels flying around to a minimum.

One thing that would be good to add is as many worked out solutions as possible.

If you have some changes that are "noncontrovertial" in the sense they are fixes, and some that are suggestions that
might need more work or review, it might be best to split them into several pull requests.
