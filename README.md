# Notes on Diffy Qs WeBWorK Problems

A set of WeBWorK problems for courses teaching a class with
the *Notes on Diffy Qs* textbook.

The problems were picked off from the Open Problem Library and somewhat (some
more than others) modified to fit the style and notation of the book.
They are essentially the same problems as those that are in the Edfinity
Notes on Diffy Qs course.

I've cleaned off the OPL tags as they are no longer needed, and some of them
were downright confusing and many were just wrong, and just made editing a
pain.

Currently should be treated as beta quality.
