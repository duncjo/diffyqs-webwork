# Webwork problems

These are problems that for whatever reason I am not pushing into the OPL Contrib directory

There are no guarantees here

*convert-to-webwork.pl* is a script that converts the D2L grade export into something that can be imported into webwork.
It probably requires modification if you want to use it yourself as it depends on exactly how you export with what fields, etc...
