* Add more Chapter 5 problems (only a couple in 5.1 are there now)

* Add 6.5 (PDE with Laplace) problems (only one is there now)

* More solutions, especially in the early sections

* ??? Add simple foxes and hares exercise in addition to the ones there

* In 8.1 add an exercise in 3D?

* Exercise 1 in 5.1 demands crazy precision, that should be fixed

* Make "arbitrary constants" be better checked throughout, especially in places
  where the student could come up with some more crazy expression.  See 1.4
  problem 1, 2, 4, 7 for affine versions.

* 1.4 #2: Should accept any multiple of the integrating factor and then should
  evaluate the rest of the problem with this in mind.  Also if taken a
  different antiderivative, that's the one that should be checked for in the
  final answer.  Basically allow alternatives but also check that they are
  consistent with one another.
