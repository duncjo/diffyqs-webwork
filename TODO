* Add more Chapter 5 problems (only a couple in 5.1 are there now)
* Add 6.5 (PDE with Laplace) problems (only one is there now)
* More solutions, especially in the early sections
* ??? Add simple foxes and hares exercise in addition to the ones there
* In 8.1 add an exercise in 3D?
* Exercise 1 in 5.1 demands crazy precision, that should be fixed
