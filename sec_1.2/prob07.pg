BEGIN_TEXT
Suppose \( \displaystyle y^{\prime} = f(x,y) = $f  \).

$PAR
\( \displaystyle \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} = \) 
\{ ans_rule(30) \}
\{ AnswerFormatHelp("formulas") \}

$PAR
The function \( f(x,y) \) is 
\{ $answer[1]->menu() \} at the point \( (0,0) \), 
the partial derivative \( \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \)
\{ $answer[2]->menu() \} at \( (0,0) \) and is \{ $answer[3]->menu() \}
at and near the point \( (0,0) \).
So the solution to 
\( y' = f(x,y) \) 
\{ $answer[4]->menu() \} near \( y(0) = 0 . \)
